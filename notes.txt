Ideate Notes 12/18/2020

Today I'm going to make a lot of changes. My objective is to change all photo storage from being saved in
the database as blobs, to be saved on the file system. 

I'm going to look up "save images to file system node"

I'm folliwng a traversy media video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qzmri1WaaE&t=90s

First use express.static to make a folder to put images in. 
Set storage engine to disk storage in multer. Takes in a destination and a file name which is a function.

use path.extname to get the file extension name.

I can then save the file info into the database, rather than the actual data.
I should check to see how much storage heroku gives me on the server, otherwise I might have to pay
anyway. It says that the free heroku dyno has 512mb of RAM. I'm guessing that's where my files would store? If I limit
them to 2mb or compress them in some way then I should be able to store 256 separate images for free.

Luckily I just heard him say that you can't do this with heroku, you have to use s3. Damn lol.

Setting up aws s3. I'm following this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDj4LPTLR3o
I made a user and downloaded csv with access keys. Apparently I also need the user arn. Click on user and copy arn.
I should also probably look into doing it with heroku. I didn't really find much results with that so I'm assuming
there's no configuration needed.


Ok so it looks like I got the aws all set up. Now I'm moving to the code.
I'm using multer-s3, and the aws-sdk.
I'm going to add the access key and secret key to heroku as config vars.

Ok so I need to change my tables for profile. I'm going to store profile_photo_filename rather than a blob. I'll change all
medium blobs to be filenames.

Ok I changed the DDL, so now I need to open up mysql workbench and recreate the database. But you know what, I'm calling it
for now.
